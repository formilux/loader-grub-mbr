Subject: [PATCH] arch/i386/pci/irq.c - new VIA chipsets (fwd)

I use 2.6.15.6 Linux kernel and found some problems. I have about 100
Linux boxes (all with the same (binary the same) kernel). Last time I have
upgraded all those boxes from 2.4.32 to 2.6.15.6 (first 2.6.15.1, next .2,
.4 and .6) and I have found some problems on VIA based PC's. Probably the
reason of this is that some VIA chipsets are unrecognized by IRQ router.

In line 586 there is: /* FIXME: add new ones for 8233/5 */

There were only a few of chipsets ID's there, some of my VIA chipsets were
not present and kernel used default IRQ router.

I have added three entries, so that the code looks like:

        case PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_82C596:
        case PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_82C686:
        case PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_8231:
        case PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_8233A:
        case PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_8235:
        case PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_8237:
        case PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_8237_SATA:
                /* FIXME: add new ones for 8233/5 */
                r->name = "VIA";
                r->get = pirq_via_get;
                r->set = pirq_via_set;
                return 1;
        }

The kernel goes fine but I haven't testes it for weeks, I'm just a moment
after reboot :)
One thing is different (better?):
Using previus kernel I had:
PCI: Via IRQ fixup for 0000:00:0f.1, from 255 to 0
now I have:
PCI: Via IRQ fixup for 0000:00:0f.1, from 255 to 11

Maybe it is good idea to add there some more VIA chipsets?
The ones I have added seem to be OK.
